ou might see a big green button at the bottom that says 'Merge pull request'. Clicking this means you'll merge your changes into the master branch.

Note that this button won't always be green. In some cases it'll be grey, which means you're faced with a merge conflict. This is when there is a change in one file that conflicts with a change in another file and git can't figure out which version to use. You'll have to manually go in and tell git which version to use.

Sometimes you'll be a co-owner or the sole owner of a repo,
